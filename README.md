# SMARAGD Security Measures Automatable for Reliable AGile Development

This application was created by Clemens HÃ¼bner during his master's thesis in computer science with the topic "Continuous Integration of Security Tests in Agile Development Processes".

For this thesis, 148 different security measures, preventing or mitigation the most common weaknesses in web applications, were analyzed and categorized regarding their ability to be transformed into agile development processes and the degree of automatic verification.

To allow an easier use of the results in development projects, this web application was designed and implemented.
